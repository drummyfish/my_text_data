Hello, my friend, you probably had a conversation with me and was redirected here. You're in the right place. I made this document to answer your burning questions.

## What is FLOSS and free culture?

FLOSS stands for **Free/Libre and Open-Source Software**. The names are somewhat confusing and weird because different people have different views and want to call it differently, and sometimes by all names at once. But basically, it's all about:

- **Free** (as in **freedom**) and **open** software, which:
  - Allows **anyone** to **use** it, **study** it, **modify** it and **improve** it.
  - Requires **the source code to be available** to everyone, in order to allow the above.
  - Is free of cost, but just as a consequence of the above. **This is not the purpose or the goal.**
- By extension free (as in freedom) **information** in general, which includes:
  - **Reducing the copyright laws** as we know them today. Copyright was made in the past to protect the authors, but **fails** to do this in the **modern days**. It now basically serves to protect companies. (Do we really need to heavily restricts **every** work **70 years after the author's death**?) Companies fight against this by inventing terms such as **piracy** to protect their profits. Don't let them make you feel guilty, it's all just bussiness.
  - Instead going for **copyleft**, which basically means providing your information to everyone for free and requiring any derived work to be released on the same terms. E.g. I draw a picture, upload it to the Internet and allow anyone to modify it on the condition that if they do, they also allow others to modify the new image.
  - **Getting rid of some kinds of patents**, particularly software patents, because they cause many, many legal problems.
  - **Protecting privacy** - In order to protect the private data of people, we have to make the systems that work with it transparent in the sence we have to know exactly what they do and how they work.
  - Supporting, encouraging and rewarding openness in general, such as creating **public domain** works.

## Why support FLOSS?

Many people have many reasons with different priorities of why you should support FLOSS. I personally think it's because of:

- practical reasons:
  - The program doesn't **depend on a company** - Proprietary (non-FLOSS) program will die with the company that develops it or when it decides it's no longer profitable (take for example the good old games). I.e. you lose all the hours you spent learning to work with the program if the company goes bankrupts, or if it decides you should use their newer product. You're at their mercy. FLOSS programs will live, be updated and supported as long as there are a few people using it.
  - **It's efficient** - You **never reinvent the wheel**. If you need to reuse a part of another program in your own program, you can. This **saves money, valuable time, effort and bugs**. With proprietary (non-FLOSS) programs, companies keep everything to themselves and refuse to share any internal code, knowledge and tools they make, and so the other companies have to always make them from scratch, which means doing design, implementatition, organisation, testing, debugging and optimizations all over again.
  - It's **transparent and safe** - You know the program **isn't spying on you or mining Bitcoin** without your knowledge.
  - It **focuses on quality** instead of profit - It's by people for the people. **No ads, no forced updates, no rushed releases, no DLCs, no bloat killer-features** that usually sell the proprietary (non-FLOSS) product but lower the quality. If anyone tries to do this with FLOSS, anyone else can revert these changes. People will then naturally use the best version of the software, the lesser quality one can't stand a chance. You may say: I've used FLOSS program X and it sucked - that's just because we yet don't support FLOSS enough to unleashe its full potential. (However note that for example the whole Internet and all supercomputers run on FLOSS, simply because it's the best choice, it's just that casual computer users limit their view to a narrow field of software that's currently ruled by proprietary products.)
  - It **supports creativity** and **educates new developers** - Anyone can learn from the source codes, try to make their own improvements and give them back for free, receive free feedback and so on. With unrestrictecd creativity, amazing things will inevitably emerge.
  - It's usually **multiplatform** - FLOSS will typically run on any platform it can run on, from Windows, Linux and Mac to mobiles and sometimes even watches and toasters. Why? Because when there's a good open code, users will typically port it to their favorite platform. As a consequence, any software built on top of it will also be able to run on these platforms. There's no monopoly trying to artificially restrict the software to their own platform.
  - It's **flexible and infinitely moddable** - Anyone can experiment and implement their wildest ideas. Want to make your car in a game go 100 times faster? You can. Want to bend a video player to draw to play a movie on a text-only screen? [You can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5My-QU2V4E).
  - There are generally **more developers** - Any person on Earth can and many **will contribute**. For free, with love, with the intent to make the software better. More developers also mean more eyes that catch more bugs, errors and inefficiencies (["given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)).
  - It **allows forking** - Forking means starting a new project from an already existing one. For example if there is a racing game, someone can take it and make a driving simulator out of it (see e.g. [Speed Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Dreams)). Someone can take a complex professional video editing software and make a simpler version for casual users. (Take a look at the [choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution#/media/File:Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg) you have when using Linux operating system, and compare it with Windows.) 
  - It's **optimizable** - When you're for example using a proprietary (non-FLOSS) graphics engine for a game or CAD application, you cannot modify it's internals to specifically suit your application. With FLOSS you can, and so your application will run faster.
  - There's **less legal hassle** - Nobody likes lawyers, reding/writing licenses and going to courts. When using FLOSS licenses, people have freedom to use the code without the fear of being sued. No communication and arguments about the terms and conditions, simply take the stuff and use it in the best way you can.
  - It's **free of cost for everyone**.
- ethical reasons (I personally prioritize these, but people usually get sold on the practical issues):
  - **Information is free by its nature**, it's only been restricted artificially by commercial interests. It's different from physical product - if you have an information and give it to someone else, **you don't lose the information**. This way you can make something and give it to all people in the world, for free, and you don't lose it. Ask yourself: if a person had an infinite supply of food and would still charge money for it, would they be a good person? Information is restricted because it supports the economy and makes more money, but can making money justify unethical practices? Would charging money for air to breathe be OK if it made more money and created more jobs? It also costs additional money to enforce the laws that artificially restrict information.
  - You (the user) are **in control of your tools** - As advocated by the [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/), you should have control over your tools, not the other way around. Proprietary (non-FLOSS) tools are by definition **not primarily made to help you**, but to **make money off of you**. Such tools resist change, customization, force their way of working on the users to help the company, not the user.

## But can I make money out of FLOSS? I need money in order to not starve to death.

You totally can make money, the point is: make money by getting paid for your work, not by selling the rights to what you create. Some ways include:

- **Sell services**: Make FLOSS, give it away, let people use it, then sell services, such as **support**, **training**, **certification**, **cutom patches**, **installation in their company**, **packaging** etc. (see [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en)).
- **Crowdfunding**: Get money to fund the development costs, then release it as FLOSS. Give people who helped fund the project special attention, e.g. let them set the direction, vote on the name, the license, make some special content for them, put them into credits, let them chat with you etc.
- **Ask for donations**: Giving away your work for free is rightfully seen as an extremely generous thing, people will support you with donations if you let them know how.
- **Sell resources**: You can create FLOSS and then offer servers to run it, possibly with additional services such as backups, auto-updates etc.
- **Sell brand product**: People are proud to use FLOSS and will pay for t-shirts, mugs, plush mascots, CDs etc.
- **Sell hardware**: People will buy HW that has free SW for it. Example: make a game console, create FLOSS games for it, let people buy the console, play the games and **improve and fix them and make new ones for free**, helping you sell more consoles.
- **Get paid by the government**: Government is paid by all people and should deliver to all people. Therefore if government pays you to write software, you should release it as FLOSS. Also applies to other areas, for example NASA releases their photos into public domain.
- **Dual-licensing**: Some software give you the choice to choose the license, usually a copyleft one (meaning you can do whatever you want except for close-sourcing it) and non-copyleft one (meaning you can close-source it), which you have to pay for. This may sometimes be seen as not 100 % correct by some purists. I see it as a possible lesser evil way in the times of transition to fully free culture.
- If you can't go full FLOSS right now, you may at least choose the lesser evil and start preparing for the transition with some **partial solutions**, such as opening only certain parts of your software (e.g. game engine while keeping the game data proprietary) or delayed open-sourcing (e.g. release as FLOSS after a year).

## Other questions

- Isn't this utopia?
  - Totally not. It's been working for as long as computers exist. There are many companies making huge money on FLOSS, FLOSS movies, authors writing copyleft licensed books (see below) etc. FLOSS powers practically the whole Internet, all supercomputers, and is partially present in all proprietary technologies you use every day.

- Isn't this communism?
  - Totally not. Communism is about trying to equally redistribute wealth which means taking away from succesful people. FLOSS isn't taking anything from anyone (except for the current arbitrary and forced restrictions) because as mentioned above, when you give information away, you still get to keep it. If communism means anything, it's censorship and effort to restrict and control people, which is exactly what closed and proprietary software does.

- I'm not a programmer, should I even care?
  - Totally, free culture is a culture for all people, goes beyond programming and needs all people in order to function best. If you support FLOSS, you not only get the direct benefits (freedom, zero cost, security, ...), but you're helping a bigger cause - you're encouraging progress, education, security, privacy protection, and figting against the evil - censorship, monopoly, meaningless jobs, abuse of personal data and so on.

- I need to use my computer for work, not experimenting, can this work for me?
  - Most likely yes. Nowadays there are only a few highly specialized areas (such as professional-level audio editing) not very well covered by FLOSS. There is a FLOSS alternative for basically any program you are using, such as Windows, MS Office, Photoshop, media players, 3D editors, game engines, audio and video editors, e-book readers, screen recorders, house interior designers, even your favorite games. These programs usually look similar and work just as well, often times much better. The user interfaces have hugely improved since the old days and are very user-friendly now.

- I'm hooked, where can I get more info and what should I do next?
  - Start using FLOSS instead of proprietary software (install [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system, also install it on your Grandma's PC), take a look at FLOSS projects, spread the word, talk to people, join the communities, donate, contribute.
