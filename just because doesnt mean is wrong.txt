"JUST BECAUSE ... DOESN'T MEAN ..." IS WRONG
============================================

I probably sent you here because you used the "Just because ... doesn't mean..."
form. Here is why it's wrong and how it's right:

REASONING
=========

This is how we usually use "because":      "I cry because I'm sad."
We can reverse the sentence order:         "Because I'm sad, I cry."
Now take a similar sentence:               "I don't cry just because I'm sad."
And reverse the order in the same way:     "Just because I'm sad, I don't cry."
We have arrived at the correct form.

SO HOW TO SAY IT PROPERLY?
==========================

Instead of:   "Just because I'm sad (it) doesn't mean I cry."     <-- WRONG
say:          "Just because I'm sad, I don't (necessarily) cry."  <-- CORRECT
or:           "Just the fact I'm sad (alone) doesn't mean I cry." <-- CORRECT
